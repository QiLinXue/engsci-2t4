    Since $\mathbb{Z}_{77}$ is abelian, the image of $\phi$ must be abelian. The group $D_{32}$ (symmetries of a $32$-gon) only has three subgroup classes that are cyclic:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Case 1: $\{0,s\}$, where $s$ is an arbitrary reflection. Note that $s$ has order $2$, but there are no elements of order $2$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{77}$, so it can't be homomorphic to this.
        \item Case 2: $\langle r^i \rangle$ where $r$ is the smallest nonzero rotation and $0 < i < 32.$ where $i | 2^5$. Therefore, the order of $r^i$ is equal to $32/i$, which will always be even. However, there are no elements of even order in $\mathbb{Z}_{77}$, so it can't be homomorphic to this.
        \item Case 3: $\{e\}$. The trivial homomorphism will always exist, and since this is the only other case (there are only reflections and rotations so cyclic groups can only be generated by a reflection or rotation), $\phi$ must be the trivial homomorphism.
    \end{itemize}
