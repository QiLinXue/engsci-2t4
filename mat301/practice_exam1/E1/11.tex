\begin{sol}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Let the distance between the black dots be $\ell$. One tile is consisted of one leaf and its corresponding black dot. The entire figure can be generated by applying a translation of $\ell$ horizontally (represented by $H$), a translation of $\ell$ vertically (represented by $V$), and a $90^\circ$ rotation (represented by $R$), with respect to the black dot.
    
    For example, we can create a coordinate system such that $(0,0)$ corresponds to the center of a black dot. To generate the flower pattern centered at $(i\ell, j\ell)$, we can perform the four operations:
    \begin{equation*}
        (jV)(iH),
        R(jV)(iH),
        R^2(jV)(iH),
        R^3(jV)(iH).
    \end{equation*}
    Therefore, the symmetry group is
    $$
    \langle R, H, V\rangle.
    $$
    \item Let $\rho$ be a bijective mapping that maps one leaf+dot to another leaf+dot. Then we can write
    $$
        \langle R\rangle \times \langle H,V \rangle = \langle R\rangle \rtimes \langle H,V\rangle
    $$
    with the binary operation:
    \begin{equation}
        (R^a, H^bV^c)(R^\alpha, H^\beta V^\gamma) = (R^a \rho(H^b)(R^\alpha), H^{b+\beta}V^{c+\gamma})
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
