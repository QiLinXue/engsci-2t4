\begin{sol}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Pick $H=\{e,s\}$, where $s$ is an arbitrary reflection and pick $a=r$ where $r$ is the smallest nonzero rotation. Then:
    $$
        aH = rH = \{r,rs\}
    $$
    and
    $$
        Ha = Hr = \{r,sr\}
    $$
    We know that $rs = sr^5 \neq sr$, and we are done.
    \item All the left cosets are
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $rH=\{r,rs\}$
        \item $r^2H = \{r^2,r^2s\}$
        \item $r^3H = \{r^3, r^3s\}$
        \item $r^4H = \{r^4, r^4s\}$
        \item $r^5H = \{r^5, r^5s\}$
        \item $eH = \{e,s\}$
    \end{itemize}
    Note that the coset $r^ksH$, where $r^ks$ is a reflection, is already contained above since $sH=H$ so $r^ksH = r^kH$. The index is $6$ as we should expect, since
    $$
    \frac{|D_6|}{|H|} = \frac{6\cdot 2}{2}=6.
    $$
\end{enumerate}
