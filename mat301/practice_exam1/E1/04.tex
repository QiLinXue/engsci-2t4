\begin{sol}
    Since $a\in G$, then $a^{-1} \in G$. Multiplying the left side of $ab=ac$ by $a^{-1}$ gives
    $$a^{-1}ab = a^{-1}ac$$
    Because the group operation is distributive, we know that this is equivalent to 
    $$(a^{-1}a)b = (a^{-1}a)c \implies eb = ec,$$
    where $e$ is the identity. We use the property that for any $x\in G$, $ex=x$ to finally conclude that $b=c$.
