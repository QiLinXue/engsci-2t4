    We can perform a similar analysis to the previous question, except we can only conclude that $x^2 \neq x$ if $x \neq e$. We can again partition the group into:
    \begin{equation}
        G = \left(\bigcup_{x \in G, x\neq e} \{x,x^2\}\right) \cup \{e\}
    \end{equation}
    where $\left|\bigcup_{x \in G, x\neq e} \{x,x^2\}\right| = 2k$. However, since we are given that $|G|$ is even, we must have $|G|=2k$ which implies  $e \in \bigcup_{x \in G, x\neq e} \{x,x^2\}$. Since $x\neq e$, we must have $x^2=e$ for some $x \in G$.
