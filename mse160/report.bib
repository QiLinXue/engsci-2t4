abstract = {Diamond is a leading contender as the material of choice for the quantum computer industry. This potential arises mainly from the quantum properties of color centers in diamond. However, before diamond can realize its full potential, the technology to fabricate and sculpt diamond as well as, if not better than, silicon must be developed. A comprehensive processing capability for diamond that will allow the fabrication of qubits and their associated photonic structures is required. Here we describe the remarkable properties of diamond color centers, and the techniques being developed to engineer qubits and sculpt monolithic structures around them. Finally we outline some of the new proposals that use engineered diamond to realize tasks not possible with existing technologies.}
