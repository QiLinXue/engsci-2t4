abstract = {Diamond is a leading contender as the material of choice for the quantum computer industry. This potential arises mainly from the quantum properties of color centers in diamond. However, before diamond can realize its full potential, the technology to fabricate and sculpt diamond as well as, if not better than, silicon must be developed. A comprehensive processing capability for diamond that will allow the fabrication of qubits and their associated photonic structures is required. Here we describe the remarkable properties of diamond color centers, and the techniques being developed to engineer qubits and sculpt monolithic structures around them. Finally we outline some of the new proposals that use engineered diamond to realize tasks not possible with existing technologies.}

abstract = {We have studied the thermal conductivity κ of free standing diamond films with different quality and sizes of the crystallines in bulk. The measurements were performed in the temperature range 10–350K by steady-state heat flux technique. We have estimated the value and temperature dependence of the phonon mean free path lp using the simple gas kinetic equation for thermal conductivity: κ≈1/3lpCpv. The values of heat capacity Cp and mean sound velocity v are known from literature for massive crystals. At high (room) temperatures the mean free path of phonons is limited by the phonon–phonon Umklapp interaction and phonon scattering on point defect in bulk. Both these processes lead to increasing of lp(T) with cooling the sample but they have different temperature dependencies. So from lp(T) dependence one can judge the quality (purity) of the sample. At low temperatures the phonon-boundary scattering dominates and lp is limited by the crystalline sizes. The mean free path of phonons in the best of samples has reached the value of a few microns at temperatures 20–70K, which agrees with the middle sizes of crystallites estimated from X-ray measurements and from microphotos. At lower temperatures the value of lp is increasing again. It can be attributed to the phonon penetration through the boundaries between crystallines. The temperature dependence of λ in this process follows l(T)∼T−(1−2).}

abstract = {Friction tests on two surfaces of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite that are parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the graphite basal plane were performed under various test conditions. The average friction coefficient value of the perpendicular surface (0.25) is higher than that of the parallel surface (0.1). The friction coefficient of both parallel and perpendicular surfaces decline when the environment is changed from wet air to wet nitrogen and the trend is more pronounced for the perpendicular surface. The perpendicular worn surface has been observed to be much rougher and owns more edge faces than the parallel worn surface. The amount of dangling bonds and chemisorbed oxygen measured on both surfaces after friction is quite different. The influence of atmosphere on the friction of graphite is attributed to the chemical reaction of dangling bonds with gases, which can affect the adhesive force of the two contact surfaces. The amount of dangling bonds generated on the sliding surface is confirmed to impact the sensitivity of graphite to gases during friction.}

abstract = {Pyrolytic carbon (PyC) is an important material used in many applications including thermal management of electronic devices and structural stability of ceramic composites. Accurate measurement of physical properties of structures containing textured PyC layers with few-micrometer thickness poses new challenges. Here a laser-based thermoreflectance technique is used to measure thermal conductivity in a 30-μm-thick textured PyC layer deposited using chemical vapor deposition on the surface of spherical zirconia particles. Raman spectroscopy is used to confirm the graphitic nature and characterize microstructure of the deposited layer. Room temperature radial and circumferential thermal conductivities are found to be 0.28 W m−1 K−1 and 11.5 W m−1 K−1, corresponding to cross-plane and in-plane conductivities of graphite. While the anisotropic ratio of the in-plane to cross-plane conductivities is smaller than previous results, the magnitude of the smallest conductivity is noticeably smaller than previously reported values for carbon materials and offers opportunities in thermal management applications. Very low in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivities are attributed to strong grain boundary scattering, high defect concentration, and small inter-laminar porosity. Experimental results agree with the prediction of thermal transport model informed by the microstructure information revealed by Raman spectroscopy.}
