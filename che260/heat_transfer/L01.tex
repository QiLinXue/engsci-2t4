    \item Mechanisms of heat transfer 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conduction: Transfer of heat through a medium that is stationary.
        \item Convection: Transfer of heat from a solid surface and an adjacent fluid that is moving.
        \item Radiation: Energy emitted by matter in the form of electromagnetic waves.
    \end{itemize}
