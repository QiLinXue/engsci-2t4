\section{Motivation}
In previous courses, we focused on $\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$ and its consequences. In this course, we will do it in a more elegant way, i.e. via Euler, Lagrange, Hamilton, Jacobi, Noether.  Some disadvantages of Newton's approach are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can be difficult to apply to complex situations and extended objects
    \item Difficult to see how chaos theory arises
    \item Obscures relationship between quantum and classical mechanics
\end{itemize}
\section{Lagrangian Mechanics}
We first start with a few examples showing Lagrangian Mechanics in action, and we will later discuss generalizations and intricacies:
\begin{example}
    Let us consider a simple system with a mass $m$ on a spring with spring constant $k$. Instead of solving this by writing $F=-kx$, let us write the following strange combination of kinetic and potential energy, known as the \textbf{Lagrangian}.:
    \begin{equation}
        L = T - V,
    \end{equation}
    where $T$ is the kinetic energy and $V$ is the potential energy. Using $T=\frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2$ and $V=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, we get:
    \begin{equation}
        L = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2 - \frac{1}{2}kx^2.
    \end{equation}
    Consider the following equation, known as the Euler-Lagrange Equation:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}}\right) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial x}
    \end{equation}
    which gives 
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{d}{dt}\left(m\dot{x}\right) = -kx \implies m\ddot{x} = -kx.
    \end{equation}
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    Suppose we have a general potential $V=V(x).$ Then the E-L equation gives
    \begin{equation}
        m\ddot{x} = -\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x}.
    \end{equation}
    Notice that $-\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x}$ is just the force!
\end{example}
If we have more than one dimension, i.e. $x,y,z$, then we'll have 3 E-L equations, and we'll have to solve them separately. The Lagrangian would be 
\begin{equation}
    L = \frac{1}{2}m\sum_i \dot{x}_i^2 - V(x_i)
\end{equation}
and the 3 different E-L equations would be
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}\right) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i} \implies m\ddot{x}_i = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_i}
\end{equation}
for $i=1,2,3$. These equations are just the $3$ components of $m\ddot{\vec{r}} = - \vec{\nabla} V(\vec{r})$. The important idea here is that we can determine the equations of motion without knowing the forces! We just need to figure out the potential energy. We can try a more complex example:
\begin{example}
    Suppose we have a mass on a spring that acts as a pendulum. The spring has equilibrium length $\ell$ and at an angle $\theta$, the spring has length $r=\ell + x$. We will work in polar coordinates $x,\theta.$ The kinetic energy is
    \begin{equation}
        T = \frac{1}{2}m\vec{v}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m\left(\dot{x}^2 + (\ell+x)^2\dot{\theta}^2\right),
    \end{equation}
    and the potential energy is
    \begin{equation}
        V = -mg(\ell+x)\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2}kx^2.
    \end{equation}
    The $E-L$ equation for $x$ gives
    \begin{align}
        \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}}\right) &= \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} \\
        m\ddot{x} &= m(\ell + x)\dot{\theta}^2 + mg\cos\theta - kx.
    \end{align}
    The term $m(\ell + x)\dot{\theta}^2$ is the centripetal force, $mg\cos\theta$ is the radial gravitational force, and $-kx$ is the spring force. The $\theta$ component is 
    \begin{equation}
        m(\ell + x)^2\dot{\theta} = mg(\ell + x)\sin\theta
    \end{equation}
    which corresponds to 
    \begin{equation}
        \vec{\tau} = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}
    \end{equation}
    where $\vec{\tau}$ is torque and $\vec{L}$ is the angular momentum.
\end{example}
